## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

Full-Stack / AI Software Engineer with **5.5+ years** of experience across US, India, and UK-based teams. Specialized in scalable backend systems, AI/LLM tooling, and HIPAA-compliant infrastructures.
My stack spans React/Next.js frontends, Node.js/NestJS & Spring Boot backends, and scalable cloud deployments (Docker, AWS, Vercel). Recently built a RAG-based chatbot with Ollama, LangChain,
and LlamaIndex, improving retrieval accuracy by 40%. Familiar with LLM fine-tuning, RLHF, vector search (FAISS), and agent-based reasoning. At Sciometrix (US), I engineered a healthcare EDI system
that reduced claim-processing errors by 30%. I’ve led full-stack development at Turing and QuestionPro, and mentored juniors at Infosys. Currently on a UK Student Visa (IR5, 20h/week allowed)
until Feb 2026. Seeking full-time employment post-graduation with visa sponsorship. Eligible to work part-time during studies.
